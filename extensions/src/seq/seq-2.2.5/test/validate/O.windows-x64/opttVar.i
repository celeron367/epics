 * from self, where delay is a variable. Test is that;
 *   i. the variable is re-initialized on the iteration even 
 *      when -t is in effect.
 *   ii.The delay is timed from the states first entry when -t is in effect,
 *      and on each entry when +t is in effect (the default). 
 *   iii. Re-entrant code, variable d is assigned properly in entry{}.
